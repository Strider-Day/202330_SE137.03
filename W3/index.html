                <p class="bio">Hi I'm <strong>Andrew Rockwell</strong>! I'm 27 years old and I am currently enrolled at NEIT under the software engineering program. I was born in Providence, RI and raised in Rumford RI my whole life. I currently live with my parents and dog while I'm still in school trying to get this degree. I already have a business administration degree, but it felt <em>VERY LACKING</em> and did not feel all that interesting to me once I had finally completed my bachelors, so <b>I decided to go back to school and study something infinitely more interesting and something I would want to keep doing past school.</b>
                    <br><br>
                <i>I enjoy software engineering</i> a lot because it honestly feels like I am playing some sort of puzzle game, experimenting with what works and what doesn't to try and find solutions to a problem to make something presentable, at least when it comes to coding anyways. Coding is super interesting to me because there are multiple languages and they are constantly evolving because of further improvement and development/updates. Within these multiple languages, I can create a lot of programs that ca be pratical or for fun, and that intrigues me due to what I can and can't do.</p>
